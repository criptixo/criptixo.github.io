# Minimalism & Terminals

Notes on keeping the stack small and the output sharp.

In a world of ever-increasing complexity, there's something beautiful about the simplicity of a terminal. The direct connection between thought and action, the efficiency of text-based interfaces, and the power that comes from understanding your tools deeply.

## The Beauty of Simplicity

When you strip away the unnecessary layers, what remains is pure functionality. A terminal doesn't need flashy animations or complex UI elements to be powerful. It just needs to work, efficiently and reliably.

## Why Terminal-First?

- **Speed**: Text is fast to render and process
- **Efficiency**: Keyboard shortcuts and commands are faster than mouse navigation
- **Flexibility**: Composable tools that work together
- **Universality**: Works the same everywhere
- **Focus**: No distractions, just you and your work

The terminal is not just a toolâ€”it's a philosophy of computing that values directness, efficiency, and understanding over convenience and abstraction.
