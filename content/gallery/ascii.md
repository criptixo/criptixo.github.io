## Neon Border

╔═══════════════════════════════╗
║  Welcome to the Terminal Zone ║
╚═══════════════════════════════╝
```

## ASCII Sunset

```
    \   |   /
     .-.-.-.
  '-(   o   )-'
     `-'-'-'
    /   |   \
```

These simple characters can create surprisingly expressive art when arranged thoughtfully. ASCII art represents the intersection of technical constraint and creative expression—making beauty from the limitations of text-only interfaces.
